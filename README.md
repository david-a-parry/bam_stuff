# bam_stuff
These scripts are designed to help fix and/or investigate problems with BAM files that may occur after some processing pipelines.

The main purpose was to be able to identify and remove duplicated reads (not PCR duplicates, but reads duplicated in silico due to pipeline errors) but some of the other scripts (such as extract_unmapped_reads_at_eof.py) may be more generally useful.
